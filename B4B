🧩 Problem B-4b (Algorithm)
Aim:

To maintain the Pinnacle Club member’s information using a Singly Linked List (SLL) and perform:

a) Deletion of the President and Secretary

b) Counting total number of members

c) Displaying all members

Algorithm
1️⃣ Start
2️⃣ Define Structure:

Define a node structure with:

PRN → student roll number

Name → student name

next → pointer to next node

3️⃣ Initialize Linked List:

Set head = NULL (empty list).

4️⃣ Function to Delete President:

Function: deletePresident()

If the list is empty (head == NULL):
→ Print “List is empty, no president to delete.”

Else:

Create a temporary pointer temp = head

Move head to next node → head = head->next

Delete temp

Print “President removed successfully.”

5️⃣ Function to Delete Secretary:

Function: deleteSecretary()

If the list is empty (head == NULL):
→ Print “List is empty, no secretary to delete.”

Else if the list has only one node (only president):

Delete that node

Set head = NULL

Print “Secretary removed (list now empty).”

Else:

Create two pointers:
temp = head, prev = NULL

Traverse until temp->next == NULL (reaches last node)

The temp node is secretary, and prev is second last node

Set prev->next = NULL

Delete temp

Print “Secretary removed successfully.”

6️⃣ Function to Count Total Members:

Function: countMembers()

Initialize count = 0

Set temp = head

While temp != NULL:

Increment count

Move to next node → temp = temp->next

Display total member count.

7️⃣ Function to Display All Members:

Function: displayList()

If list is empty → Print “No members in the club.”

Else:

Set temp = head

Traverse through the list:

If node is first → print “President: PRN, Name”

If node is last → print “Secretary: PRN, Name”

Else → print “Member: PRN, Name”

Move temp to next node until end of list.

8️⃣ Stop
